# Duck Matching Game
This is a responsive matching game using JQuery / JavaScript, Bootstrap, and Knockout. 

I created this to get more experience with Knockout and Bootstrap.

# How to Play
Download and extract the zip file for this repo, and then open index.html

Your goal is to pick 2 tiles that match on each turn. If you pick tiles that match, then they disappear and you need to find all the other matches. Try to find all the matches in the least amount of turns possible.

# Future Enhancements
Below are some ideas for future enhancements, though I may end up recreating the game without Knockout. When you use Knockout's data-binds to change the image displayed or hide it, then there is no real way to do animation for a card flipping over.

Future enhancements include:
- Allow user to select the type of image to match (add something besides ducks)
- Save how many turns the player took to local storage and show them what their record was (how many turns it took them to win a game) and also what the score was in their previous game.
- Let user select their own images and use local storage to hold them.
